                        A loan against property, commonly known as LAP, is a type of secured loan where
                        individuals can leverage their property as collateral to obtain funds from a
                        financial institution. This form of financing provides borrowers with access to
                        substantial amounts of capital at relatively lower interest rates compared to
                        unsecured loans. The property offered as collateral can be residential,
                        commercial, or industrial, and its value determines the loan amount sanctioned.
                        One of the key advantages of a loan against property is its versatility in usage;
                        borrowers can utilize the funds for various purposes such as business expansion,
                        debt consolidation, education expenses, or any other financial need. However, it's
                        crucial for borrowers to exercise caution and ensure timely repayment, as
                        defaulting on payments can lead to the risk of losing the property pledged as
                        collateral.
